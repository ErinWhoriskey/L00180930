## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do not create a public GitHub issue.**  
This helps prevent exploitation before a fix is available.

### What Happens Next
- I will review the report and confirm whether the issue is valid.  
- If accepted, I will work on a fix and keep you updated on progress.  
- After the issue is resolved, a security advisory may be published.  


### Scope

- Code execution, privilege escalation, or authentication bypass  
- Leaks of sensitive data   
- Denial of service that significantly affects availability  

Non-security issues should be reported through normal GitHub issues.
